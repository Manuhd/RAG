# 🚀 **Transformer Architecture — Step-by-Step**

This is the EXACT internal workflow of an LLM.

---

# **1️⃣ Input Tokenization**

The text is broken into tokens.

Example:
“What is RAG?” → ["What", "is", "RAG", "?"]

---

# **2️⃣ Convert Tokens → Embeddings**

Each token becomes a dense vector:

```
"What" → [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]
"is"   → [0.2, 0.1, 0.5, ...]
"RAG"  → [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, ...]
```

These embeddings capture meaning.

---

# **3️⃣ Add Positional Encoding**

Transformers do NOT know order.
So we add positional encoding:

```
Embedding + PE(position)
```

This tells model:

* which word is 1st
* which is 2nd
* etc.

---

# **4️⃣ Self-Attention (Q, K, V creation)**

For each token, the model creates 3 vectors:

* **Q = Query**
* **K = Key**
* **V = Value**

These come from learned matrices:

```
Q = Wq * embedding  
K = Wk * embedding  
V = Wv * embedding
```

This is like converting a word into **what it should focus on**.

---

# **5️⃣ Attention Score Calculation**

Attention score = **dot product(Q, K)**

This tells **how much one word should attend to another word**.

Example:

* "RAG" attends a lot to "Retrieval"
* but less to "is"

---

# **6️⃣ Softmax → Normalize Scores**

Softmax converts scores into weights:

```
0.60 → strong relation  
0.30 → medium  
0.10 → weak
```

These weights sum to 1.

---

# **7️⃣ Weighted Sum of V**

Final attention output:

```
Attention output = Σ (weight * V)
```

This produces a new representation of each word
→ now enriched with context.

---

# **8️⃣ Multi-Head Attention**

The above attention is done **8, 16, 32... times in parallel**.

Each head learns something different:

* head 1 → grammar
* head 2 → meaning
* head 3 → long-distance relations
* head 4 → reasoning
* etc.

Outputs are concatenated.

---

# **9️⃣ Add & Norm (Residual Connection)**

To keep training stable:

```
output = LayerNorm(input + attention_output)
```

Residual connections prevent vanishing gradients.

---

# **🔟 Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**

Each token passes through a small neural network:

```
FFN = ReLU(W1*x + b1)
FFN = W2*FFN + b2
```

This adds non-linearity, reasoning, transformation.

---

# **1️⃣1️⃣ Add & Norm Again**

Same structure:

```
output = LayerNorm(input + FFN_output)
```

This completes one Transformer **block**.

---

# **1️⃣2️⃣ Stack 12 → 80+ Layers**

A Transformer has many layers.

Example:

* GPT-3 → 96 layers
* GPT-4 → 120+ layers
* Llama-3 → 80 layers

More layers → more reasoning + memory.

---

# **1️⃣3️⃣ Decoder Predicts Next Token**

For LLMs (decoder-only):

Given context, the model predicts the next word:

```
“What is full form of RAG?” → “Retrieval”
Then → “Augmented”
Then → “Generation”
```

This repeats until the answer is complete.

# **Transformer Architecture – Steps & Meaning (Table)**

| **Step**                                 | **Meaning (Simple Explanation)**                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Tokenization**                      | Break input text into small units (tokens) like words/subwords.                                  |
| **2. Embeddings**                        | Convert each token into a numerical vector that represents meaning.                              |
| **3. Positional Encoding**               | Add position information so model knows order of words.                                          |
| **4. Create Q, K, V**                    | For each token, compute **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, **Value (V)** using learned weight matrices. |
| **5. Attention Score (Q·K)**             | Calculate similarity between words to know how much each word should focus on another word.      |
| **6. Softmax**                           | Convert attention scores into probabilities (weights that sum to 1).                             |
| **7. Weighted Sum of V**                 | Combine value vectors using attention weights to create context-aware representation.            |
| **8. Multi-Head Attention**              | Repeat attention multiple times in parallel; each head learns different relationships.           |
| **9. Add & Norm (Residual + LayerNorm)** | Add original input + attention output, then normalize to keep training stable.                   |
| **10. Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**       | Apply a small neural network to each token for deeper transformation/reasoning.                  |
| **11. Add & Norm**                       | Add FFN output back to input (residual) and normalize again.                                     |
| **12. Stack Many Layers**                | Repeat attention + FFN blocks 12–100+ times to increase understanding.                           |
| **13. Predict Next Token**               | Model generates the next word using learned patterns and context.                                |
